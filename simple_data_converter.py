Simple Math Dataset Converter
=============================

Hey! This script converts your mathematics dataset txt files into the JSON format 
needed for training. I wrote this to be as straightforward as possible.

Just run: python simple_data_converter.py

It'll look for your dataset files and convert them automatically.
No fancy stuff, just gets the job done.
